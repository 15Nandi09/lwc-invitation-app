# 🎉 Invitation App Built with Salesforce

This is a dynamic web application I developed as part of a Salesforce development course. The app showcases my hands-on experience with **Experience Cloud**, **Lightning Web Components (LWC)**, **Apex**, and other modern Salesforce technologies.

The application allows users to create, manage, and RSVP to events through a responsive and user-friendly interface.
